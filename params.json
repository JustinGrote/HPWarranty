However the Get-HPEntWarrantyEntitlement is not.\r\n\r\n~~This module can be installed from the [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HPWarranty/).  You need [WMF 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44987) to use this feature.~~\r\ncurrently disabled until the enterprise cmdlet is working again.\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInstall-Module -Name HPWarranty\r\n```\r\n\r\nHP has recently split into two divisions, and this a first attempt to support both HP server and workstation warranty via PowerShell.\r\nI currently have no way to check if a machine is a 'Server' or a 'Workstaion', so that falls on you, for now.  I have added the error returned from HP to the errorstream, so you should be able to tell what the issue is more easily.\r\nThis is still very beta, so please report any issues.
