# HPWarranty PowerShell Module

## **Finally getting this working a bit again, refractor in progress.**

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/7vp1jrn1vtssy635?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dotps1/hpwarranty)

This module can be installed from the [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HPWarranty/).  You need [WMF 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44987) to use this feature.
```PowerShell
Install-Module -Name HPWarranty
```

HP has recently split into two divisions, and this a first attempt to support both HP server and workstation warranty via PowerShell.
I currently have no way to check if a machine is a 'Server' or a 'Workstation', so that falls on you, for now.  I have added the error returned from HP to the errorstream, so you should be able to tell what the issue is more easily.
This is still very beta, so please report any issues.  Thanks.

Example 1:
```PowerShell
# Execute from local HP workstation.
Get-HPIncWarrantyEntitlement

# This is not done by default, and will need to be done in your client settings.
